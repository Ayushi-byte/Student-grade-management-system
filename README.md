# Student-grade-management-system


**** Project Overview

The Student Grade Management System is a simple Python-based console application designed to store, update, delete, and display student grades using a dictionary. This project demonstrates core Python concepts such as functions, loops, conditionals, and data handling.

The program allows users to interact through a menu-driven interface, making it easy for beginners to understand how CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations work.



⭐ Features

➕ Add Student – Insert a new student and their grade.

✏ Update Student – Modify the grade of an existing student.

❌ Delete Student – Remove a student from the dictionary.

📋 View All Students – Display the list of all students with their grades.

🚪 Exit Program – Close the application safely.
