####Project Statement Document
Student Grade Management System (Console-Based Application)
1.) Problem Statement

In educational environments, teachers and administrators often need a quick and simple way to record, update, 
delete, and view student grades. Managing this information manually (on paper or in spreadsheets) can become
inefficient, error-prone, and time-consuming, especially when handling a growing list of students.

There is a need for a lightweight, easy-to-use, and beginner-friendly system that can 
perform basic grade management tasks without the complexity of a full database or web system.
The goal is to create a console-based application that simplifies grade tracking and provides a smoother workflow for users.

2.) Scope of the Project

This project focuses on developing a simple command-line Student Grade Management System using Python.
The system performs basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a list of students and their grades.

Included in Scope

Adding new students along with their grades

Updating existing students' grades

Deleting student records

Displaying all stored student data

Handling invalid user input (improving reliability)

Running the system interactively through a console menu

Excluded from Scope

Multi-user accounts or authentication

Storing data in external files or databases

Advanced grading analytics or reporting

User interface beyond command-line (no GUI/web interface)

However, these features can be added in future enhancements.

3.) Target Users

The system is designed for:

 Teachers and Educators

To manage small class lists

To quickly update and review grades

 ***Teachers

To maintain basic grade records for learners

*** Students Learning Python

To understand CRUD operations

To practice dictionary usage and input validation

To learn menu-driven program design

*** Small Institutions / Training Centers

That need a simple, cost-free digital grade tracker

4. High-Level Features
 1. Add Student

Allows the user to enter a student’s name and grade.
Stores it in the dictionary for easy retrieval.

 2. Update Student Details

If the student exists, their grade can be updated.
If not found, the program notifies the user.

 3. Delete Student

Removes a student entry from the dictionary.
Helps maintain up-to-date grade records.

 4. View All Students

Displays the list of all students and their grades.
Useful for quick review and verification.

 5. Menu-Driven Interface

The program displays a clean menu, allowing smooth navigation.

6. Input Validation

Ensures user inputs (such as menu choices and grades)
are numeric and valid, preventing system crashes.

 7. Simple, Lightweight Architecture

Uses a Python dictionary — fast, efficient, and straightforward.

5. Summary

The Student Grade Management System is a beginner-friendly, console-based Python application designed to perform essential grade-tracking tasks.
It provides teachers and learners with a simple, reliable, and efficient way to manage student records.
The project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like dictionaries, 
functions, loops, and input validation, making it ideal for small-scale use and educational purposes.
